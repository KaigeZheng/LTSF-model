## LSTF-model

We plan to use a modern PyTorch framework in this repository to reproduce long-term time series forecasting models such as DLinear, Transformer, Autoformer, and PatchTST, while implementing certain levels of code optimization. The implementation of the repository's code partially references source code repositories like Autoformer and Informer.

## How to run?

```shell
# pip install -r requirements.txt
sh ./run.sh
```
